For compiling on Windows, there are a couple options.

1) Setup a unix-like environment such as cygwin or mingw,
   and use the existing Makefiles.
   This purportedly works, but we haven't used it ourselves.

2) Use CMake to generate a Visual Studio project file,
   and compile everything using Visual Studio.
   Here are instructions for using CMake.

Install CMake. We used version 2.8.11.2, available from
http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/

Unpack the MAGMA distribution. Let's say it's in directory c:\magma.

Run the CMake GUI. A window will appear with two questions:

   Where is the source code:
   Enter the directory where you unpacked MAGMA, e.g., c:\magma

   Where to build the binaries:
   Enter a new directory in which to build MAGMA, e.g., c:\magma\build
   This must be different than the previous MAGMA directory, i.e.,
   we do not allow in-place builds.

Click the Configure button.

It will ask to create the build directory; enter Yes.

It will ask what generator to use. We used "Visual Studio 10 Win64",
with the default native compilers. Click Finish.

It should spend a few minutes analyzing your system, then return to the
main window with an initial configuration. Likely you will want to tweak
the setup some.

1) It seems to find CUDA fine, but you can adjust any CUDA settings there.
   We used the defaults.

2) It probably won't find LAPACK on Windows. Set the LAPACK_LIBRARIES to
   a semi-colon separated list of libraries. For Intel MKL, we used
   (all on one line, no spaces before or after):

   c:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\Composer XE\mkl\lib\intel64\mkl_intel_lp64_dll.lib;c:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\Composer XE\mkl\lib\intel64\mkl_intel_thread_dll.lib;c:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\Composer XE\mkl\lib\intel64\mkl_core_dll.lib;c:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\Composer XE\compiler\lib\intel64\libiomp5md.lib
   
   For MKL, you can determine what libraries to link with using the
   Intel MKL Link Link Advisor, at
   http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-mkl-link-line-advisor

3) If using Intel MKL, also set MKLROOT. In our case, we used:
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\Composer XE\mkl

4) GPU_TARGET contains one or more of Tesla, Fermi, or Kepler,
   to specify for which GPUs you want to compile MAGMA:
       Tesla  - NVIDIA compute capability 1.x cards
       Fermi  - NVIDIA compute capability 2.x cards
       Kepler - NVIDIA compute capability 3.x cards
   The default is all, "Tesla Fermi Kepler".
   See http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus

Click Configure again.
Click Generate.

Close Cmake.

Open the Visual Studio (VS) solution file, build\magma.sln

In the Toolbar, select the desired Solution Configuration:
   Debug
   Release
   etc.

From the Build menu, run Build Solution.
VS does not support parallel builds with nvcc, so it will take a long time
to build -- perhaps an hour.

Once built, the MAGMA library and testers should be in
   build\lib\Debug\
   build\testing\Debug\
where "Debug" depends on what solution configuration you chose.

CMake would not compile Fortran and C++ files in the same library, so Fortran
files are compiled into a separate magmaf library. Currently, it is only
required for the non-symmetric eigenvalue problem, though.
