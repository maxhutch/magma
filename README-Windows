For compiling MAGMA on Windows, there are a couple options.

1) Setup a unix-like environment such as cygwin or mingw,
   and use the existing Makefiles.
   This purportedly works, but we haven't used it ourselves.

2) Use CMake to generate a Visual Studio project file,
   and compile everything using Visual Studio.
   Here are instructions for using CMake.

Install CMake. We used version 2.8.11.2, available from
http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/

Unpack the MAGMA distribution. Let's say it's in directory c:\magma.

Run the CMake GUI. A window will appear with two questions:

   Where is the source code:
   Enter the directory where you unpacked MAGMA, e.g., c:\magma

   Where to build the binaries:
   Enter a new directory in which to build MAGMA, e.g., c:\magma\build
   This must be different than the previous MAGMA directory, i.e.,
   we do not allow in-place builds.

Click the Configure button.

It will ask to create the build directory; enter Yes.

It will ask what generator to use. We used "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64",
with the default native compilers. Click Finish.

It should spend a few minutes analyzing your system, then return to the
main window with an initial configuration. Likely you will want to tweak
the setup some.

*  If you do NOT have Fortran, set USE_FORTRAN to off. Run Configure again, then
   if needed, change FORTRAN_CONVENTION to one of -DADD_, -DNOCHANGE, -DUPCASE;
   see README. Note that some testers will have reduced functionality.

*  It seems to find CUDA fine, but you can adjust any CUDA settings there.
   We used the defaults.

*  It probably won't find LAPACK on Windows. Set the LAPACK_LIBRARIES to
   a semi-colon separated list of libraries. For Intel MKL, we used
   (all on one line, no spaces before or after):

   c:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\Composer XE\mkl\lib\intel64\mkl_intel_lp64_dll.lib;c:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\Composer XE\mkl\lib\intel64\mkl_intel_thread_dll.lib;c:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\Composer XE\mkl\lib\intel64\mkl_core_dll.lib;c:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\Composer XE\compiler\lib\intel64\libiomp5md.lib
   
   For MKL, you can determine what libraries to link with using the
   Intel MKL Link Link Advisor, at
   http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-mkl-link-line-advisor
   
   For OpenBLAS, we used (again, no spaces before or after):
   
   c:\openblas-0.2.14\lib\libopenblas.dll.a

*  If using Intel MKL, also set MKLROOT. In our case, we used:
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\Composer XE\mkl

*  GPU_TARGET contains one or more of Fermi, Kepler, or Maxwell,
   to specify for which GPUs you want to compile MAGMA:
       Fermi   - NVIDIA compute capability 2.x cards
       Kepler  - NVIDIA compute capability 3.x cards
       Maxwell - NVIDIA compute capability 5.x cards
   The default is "Fermi Kepler".
   See http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus

Click Configure again.
Click Generate.

Close Cmake.

Open the Visual Studio (VS) solution file, build\magma.sln

In the Toolbar, select the desired Solution Configuration:
   Debug
   Release
   etc.

From the Build menu, run Build Solution.
VS does not support parallel builds with nvcc, so it will take a long time
to build -- perhaps several hours.

Once built, the MAGMA library and testers should be in
   build\lib\Debug\
   build\testing\Debug\
where "Debug" depends on what solution configuration you chose.
