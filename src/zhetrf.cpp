/**
    Purpose
    =======
 
    ZHETRF computes the factorization of a complex Hermitian matrix A
    using the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting method.  The form of the
    factorization is
 
        A = U*D*U^H  or  A = L*D*L^H
 
    where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
    triangular matrices, and D is Hermitian and block diagonal with
    1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

    This is the blocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.

    Arguments
    ---------
    @param[in]
    uplo    magma_uplo_t
      -     = MagmaUpper:  Upper triangle of A is stored;
      -     = MagmaLower:  Lower triangle of A is stored.
 
    @param[in]
    n       INTEGER
            The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
  
    @param[in,out]
    A       COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
            On entry, the Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = MagmaUpper, the leading
            N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
            triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
            triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = MagmaLower, the
            leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
            triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
            triangular part of A is not referenced.
    \n
            On exit, the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
            to obtain the factor U or L (see below for further details).
 
    @param[in]
    lda     INTEGER
            The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
 
    @param[out]
    ipiv    INTEGER array, dimension (N)
            Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D.
            If IPIV(k) > 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
            interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
            If UPLO = MagmaUpper and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) < 0, then rows and
            columns k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
            is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.  If UPLO = MagmaLower and IPIV(k) =
            IPIV(k+1) < 0, then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were
            interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

    @param[out]
    info    INTEGER
      -     = 0:  successful exit
      -     < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
      -     > 0:  if INFO = i, D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
                  has been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
                  exactly singular, and division by zero will occur if it
                  is used to solve a system of equations.

    Further Details
    ===============
    If UPLO = MagmaUpper, then A = U*D*U', where
    U = P(n)*U(n)* ... *P(k)U(k)* ...,
    i.e., U is a product of terms P(k)*U(k), where k decreases from n to
    1 in steps of 1 or 2, and D is a block diagonal matrix with 1-by-1
    and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks D(k).  P(k) is a permutation matrix as
    defined by IPIV(k), and U(k) is a unit upper triangular matrix, such
    that if the diagonal block D(k) is of order s (s = 1 or 2), then
 
               (   I    v    0   )   k-s
       U(k) =  (   0    I    0   )   s
               (   0    0    I   )   n-k
                  k-s   s   n-k
 
    If s = 1, D(k) overwrites A(k,k), and v overwrites A(1:k-1,k).
    If s = 2, the upper triangle of D(k) overwrites A(k-1,k-1), A(k-1,k),
    and A(k,k), and v overwrites A(1:k-2,k-1:k).
  
    If UPLO = MagmaLower, then A = L*D*L', where
       L = P(1)*L(1)* ... *P(k)*L(k)* ...,
    i.e., L is a product of terms P(k)*L(k), where k increases from 1 to
    n in steps of 1 or 2, and D is a block diagonal matrix with 1-by-1
    and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks D(k).  P(k) is a permutation matrix as
    defined by IPIV(k), and L(k) is a unit lower triangular matrix, such
    that if the diagonal block D(k) is of order s (s = 1 or 2), then
  
               (   I    0     0   )  k-1
       L(k) =  (   0    I     0   )  s
               (   0    v     I   )  n-k-s+1
                  k-1   s  n-k-s+1
  
    If s = 1, D(k) overwrites A(k,k), and v overwrites A(k+1:n,k).
    If s = 2, the lower triangle of D(k) overwrites A(k,k), A(k+1,k),
    and A(k+1,k+1), and v overwrites A(k+2:n,k:k+1).
